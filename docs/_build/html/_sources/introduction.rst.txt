Introduction
============

Welcome to the Nico Documentation!

NiCo ( **Ni** che **Co** variation) is a tool designed for the comprehensive analysis of imaging and sequencing based spatial transcriptomics data. This documentation provides detailed instructions on how to use the tool, including installation, usage examples, and API references.

Key Features:
-------------

- **Cell Type Annotation:** Accurately annotate cell types on spatial modality by label transfer.
- **Visualization Spatial Cell Types in UMAP:** Generate UMAP plots and spatial maps to visualize cell types.
- **Spatial Neighborhood Analysis:** Identify and analyze cell type-cell type interactions within spatial neighborhoods.
- **Infer Cell State Covariation:** Analyze molecular crosstalk in niche cell type within the latent variable space.
- **Visualization of Ligand and Receptors:** NiCo visualizes ligands and receptors as rectangular plots in the latent variable space of covarying cellular states.
- **Visualization of Pathways:** NiCo visualizes enriched pathways in the top correlated genes of the latent variable space for each cell type.


Getting Started:
----------------
